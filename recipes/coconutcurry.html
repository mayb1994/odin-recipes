    <h2>Coconut Chicken Red Curry | A Thai Classic</h2>
    <p>
        Thai food is without a doubt my ultimate comfort food. I can enjoy Thai food for any meal, any season, drunken nights - You Name It!! This Thai dish is an entry level delight for both taste and an attempt at cooking with flavors you may not be used to.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 to 3 tbsp Coconut Oil</li>
        <li>1 medium/large Yellow Onion</li>
        <li>1 lb Boneless Skinless Chicken Breast</li>
        <li>3 Cloves Garlic</li>
        <li>2 to 3 tsp ground Ginger or 1 tbsp fresh Ginger, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground Coriander</li>
        <li>1- 13-ounce can Coconut Milk</li>
        <li>1 to 1 1/2 cups Shredded Carrots</li>
        <li>1 to 3 tbsp Thai Red Curry Paste</li>
        <li>1 tsp Kosher Salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp freshly ground Black Pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>about 3 cups Fresh Spinach Leaves</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Lime Juice</li>
        <li>1 to 2 tbsp Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Fresh Cilantro</li>
        <li>Jasmine Rice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To a large skillet, add the oil, onion, and saut√© over medium-high heat until the onion begins to soften about 5 minutes; stir intermittently.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken and cook for about 5 minutes, or until chicken is done; flip and stir often to ensure even cooking.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic, ginger, coriander, and cook for about 1 minute, or until fragrant; stir frequently.</li>
        <li>Add the coconut milk, carrots, Thai curry paste, salt, pepper, and stir to combine. Reduce the heat to medium, and allow mixture to gently boil for about 5 minutes, or until liquid volume has reduced as much as desired and thickens slightly.</li>
        <li>Add the spinach, lime juice, and stir to combine. Cook until spinach has wilted and is tender, about 1 to 2 minutes. Taste and optionally add brown sugar, additional curry paste, salt, pepper, etc. to taste.</li>
        <li>Evenly sprinkle with the cilantro and serve immediately. Curry is best warm and fresh but will keep airtight in the fridge for up to 1 week.</li>
    </ol>
